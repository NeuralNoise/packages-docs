Using the web interface
=======================

You can login with the configured credentials you specified in `config.yml`.


### Creating Remotes

Before you can use Packages, you need to configure a GitHub or GitLab remote. Do this by logging into the
web interface and going to Remotes. Add a Remote, select the Remote type, then configure any additional
parameters necessary for the chosen type.

Now, Sync your remote to create a package within your Packages installation.


### Enabling Package plugins

After you have synced your Remote, you can configure each package. Go to Packages and click Edit on one of your
packages. Check the "Enabled" checkbox to enable and configure further plugins.
